# Investment Duration Fix - "0/undefined days" Issue ✅

## Issue Reported
User saw `0/undefined days` in the Active Investments section:
```
Progress: 0/undefined days
Days Remaining: 0 days
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem:
The `Investment` interface and the UI component had a **data structure mismatch**:

**Investment Interface (Backend)**:
```typescript
export interface Investment {
  duration_months: number  // ✅ Had this
  start_date: string
  end_date: string
  // ❌ Missing: duration, days_elapsed, days_remaining
}
```

**Active Investments Component (Frontend)**:
```typescript
// Line 199: Tried to access non-existent fields
value={`${investment.days_elapsed || 0}/${investment.duration} days`}
//                    ❌ undefined          ❌ undefined
```

The component expected:
- `duration` (in days)
- `days_elapsed` (days since start)
- `days_remaining` (days until maturity)

But the interface only had `duration_months` and date strings.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Step 1: Updated Investment Interface ✅

**File**: `server/actions/portfolio.ts`

Added missing fields to the `Investment` interface:

```typescript
export interface Investment {
  id: number
  plan_name: string
  plan_type: 'crypto' | 'stocks' | 'currencies'
  amount_invested: number
  current_value: number
  profit: number
  roi: number
  duration_months: number
  duration: number  // ✅ NEW: Duration in days (for UI)
  days_elapsed?: number  // ✅ NEW: Days since start
  days_remaining?: number  // ✅ NEW: Days until maturity
  start_date: string
  end_date: string
  status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'cancelled'
  risk_level: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  strategy?: string  // ✅ NEW: Investment strategy
}
```

### Step 2: Added Calculation Logic ✅

**File**: `server/actions/portfolio.ts` - `getActiveInvestmentsAction()`

Added processing to calculate the missing fields from dates:

```typescript
// Process investments to add calculated fields
const rawInvestments = ((user as any).active_investments as Investment[]) || []
const processedInvestments = rawInvestments.map(investment => {
  const startDate = new Date(investment.start_date)
  const endDate = new Date(investment.end_date)
  const now = new Date()

  // Calculate duration in days
  const durationInDays = Math.ceil(
    (endDate.getTime() - startDate.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
  )
  
  // Calculate days elapsed since start
  const daysElapsed = Math.max(0, Math.ceil(
    (now.getTime() - startDate.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
  ))
  
  // Calculate days remaining until maturity
  const daysRemaining = Math.max(0, Math.ceil(
    (endDate.getTime() - now.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
  ))

  return {
    ...investment,
    duration: durationInDays,        // ✅ Total duration in days
    days_elapsed: daysElapsed,       // ✅ Days since start
    days_remaining: daysRemaining    // ✅ Days until end
  }
})

return {
  success: true,
  data: {
    investments: processedInvestments,  // ✅ Return processed data
    total_invested: (user as any).total_invested || 0,
    investment_returns: (user as any).investment_returns || 0,
  },
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Example Investment Data:

**Database Record**:
```json
{
  "plan_name": "Crypto Growth Fund",
  "amount_invested": 15000,
  "start_date": "2024-01-01",
  "end_date": "2024-04-01",  // 90 days duration
  "status": "active"
}
```

**After Processing** (assuming today is 2024-02-01):
```json
{
  "plan_name": "Crypto Growth Fund",
  "amount_invested": 15000,
  "start_date": "2024-01-01",
  "end_date": "2024-04-01",
  "duration": 90,           // ✅ Calculated: 90 days total
  "days_elapsed": 31,       // ✅ Calculated: 31 days passed
  "days_remaining": 59,     // ✅ Calculated: 59 days left
  "status": "active"
}
```

**UI Display**:
```
Progress: 31/90 days     ✅ Fixed!
Days Remaining: 59 days  ✅ Fixed!
Progress Bar: 34%        ✅ Working!
```

## Calculation Details

### 1. Duration (Total Days)
```typescript
const durationInDays = Math.ceil(
  (endDate - startDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
)
```
- Calculates total days between start and end date
- Rounds up using `Math.ceil()`
- Result: `90 days`, `180 days`, etc.

### 2. Days Elapsed
```typescript
const daysElapsed = Math.max(0, Math.ceil(
  (now - startDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
))
```
- Calculates days since investment started
- Uses `Math.max(0, ...)` to prevent negative values
- Rounds up using `Math.ceil()`
- Result: `0`, `31`, `45`, etc.

### 3. Days Remaining
```typescript
const daysRemaining = Math.max(0, Math.ceil(
  (endDate - now) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
))
```
- Calculates days until investment matures
- Uses `Math.max(0, ...)` to handle matured investments
- Rounds up using `Math.ceil()`
- Result: `90`, `59`, `0`, etc.

### 4. Progress Percentage
```typescript
const progress = investment.duration > 0 
  ? ((investment.days_elapsed || 0) / investment.duration) * 100
  : 0
```
- Calculates percentage of time passed
- Prevents division by zero
- Used for circular progress indicator
- Result: `0%` to `100%`

## UI Components Updated

### Active Investments Component
**File**: `components/dashboard/investment/active-investments.tsx`

**Before** (Line 199):
```tsx
value={`${investment.days_elapsed || 0}/${investment.duration} days`}
//                    ❌ undefined          ❌ undefined
// Displayed: "0/undefined days"
```

**After** (Same line, but with processed data):
```tsx
value={`${investment.days_elapsed || 0}/${investment.duration} days`}
//                    ✅ 31                ✅ 90
// Displays: "31/90 days"
```

**Progress Calculation** (Line 132-134):
```tsx
const progress = investment.duration > 0 
  ? ((investment.duration - (investment.days_remaining || 0)) / investment.duration) * 100
  : 0
// Now works correctly: ((90 - 59) / 90) * 100 = 34.4%
```
